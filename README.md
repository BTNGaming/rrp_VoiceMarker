# [Release] rrp_VoiceMarker

## Features

Adds a marker above players heads while they are talking. (Default style is Sims Style icon above player head)

(Just adds a little when you have a large group and need to know who's speaking.)

Has a full config file to adjust the marker type, size, location, optional bouncing, and if you want it to always face the camera when you look around (With instructions).

INFO: You CAN set the marker height to a NEGATIVE number to bring it lower like FamilyRP-Style-Voice with their circle on the players feet.
